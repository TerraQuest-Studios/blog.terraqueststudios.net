## About Me

Hey, Im [wsor(4035)](https://github.com/wsor4035/), a software dev that likes play with random ideas and learn new things. These days 
I spend a lot of time in the [Luanti Project](https://github.com/luanti-org/) being involved as an [ContentDb](https://content.minetest.net/) 
editor, engine triager, Discord staff member, docs contributor, [mt-mods](https://github.com/mt-mods)/[mt-historical](https://github.com/mt-historical) 
memeber, etc..... which in writting this all out is to much :p.

## This Blog

Honestly I've been thinking about doing a blog for the longest time, however I've just been lazy. Recently I have been contributing to 
[luanti's documentation efforts](https://github.com/luanti-org/dev.luanti.org) which lead to using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and I quite 
liked it. The experience of using it for the docs project, and some poking by a friend to actually make this pushed me over the edge into 
executing on it.

You may be wondering at this point .....so what will this blog have? In short, IDK. The longer answer is probably random articles about things I find 
interesting, enough so to write about(something I'm not the best at).

## Whats Next?

In short, keep an eye on the blog for new posts. If you are so technically inclined, feel free to open a pr on the
